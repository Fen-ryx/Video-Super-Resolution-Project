# Video-Super-Resolution-Project
This is my Video Super Resolution Project, under the Seasons of Code Program organized by the WnCC, IIT Bombay

# Materials Studied
For this project, I had to learn Python, and then TensorFlow.
I had to take the 11-week Machine Learning Course on Coursera by Andrew Ng.
I implemented some of the things I learnt through the programming assignments available as part of the course, using  Octave. This code is available under the Machine-Learning-Octave-Code branch.
Some Learning Algorithms have been implemented using the estimators available on TensorFlow. The code is based upon a tutorial I watched online (it was part of the resources provided to me by my mentor) and the code used in that tutorial was pulled from the TensorFlow site. While it might seem like a copy and paste of that cade, it is something I've written myself, so as to get familiarized with the syntax, while occasionally (read: frequently) consulting the available code :)
MNIST Classification is something I wrote myself while consulting the Classification code I wrote. To the best of my knowledge, this code isn't available anywhere.
